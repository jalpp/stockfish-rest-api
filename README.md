Work in progress Stockfish REST API

making this for my own chess discord bots and other chess software that need
stockfish best moves within 3 seconds. (I'm NOT trying to sell this or whatever in the name of Stockfish), 
mostly used for internal software, and of course it be free if I deploy it for other devs!!

Please note this is not ready to use yet.. (I mean you can) if you really want to,

just run ```node server.js``` I guess

License follows same as Stockfish GPL
